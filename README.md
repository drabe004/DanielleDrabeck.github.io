# Hi, I’m Dr. Danielle H. Drabeck

I’m a **comparative genomics and evolutionary data scientist** interested in how we can use large-scale data to understand biological adaptation, convergence, and resilience.  
My research and computational tools focus on connecting biological theory with data-driven modeling — turning complex genomic data into testable evolutionary hypotheses.

---

### What I Do

- Build reproducible pipelines for **comparative genomics, selection testing, and orthology inference**.  
- Combine **bioinformatics, data science, and evolutionary theory** to study adaptive change in mammals and fishes.  
- Develop and maintain open-source workflows for scalable data processing on HPC systems (SLURM, Linux).
- Develop novel programs for orthology inference across extremely diverse vertebrate genomes
